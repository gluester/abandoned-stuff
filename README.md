## What to expect
* Skripts

##### My Bitbucket, where I may put abandoned things in the future: https://bitbucket.org/%7B409e6677-33b3-46d6-be49-a87cf1c93376%7D/
###### My Bitbucket profile also links to HiRow MC, (originally, was going to be here on GitHub, but, due to some things it's ..not) which may soon contain a lot of Skripts.
